<p><strong> AI painting</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;What is AI painting?</p>
<p>&nbsp;AI generated paintings are exactly what they sound like - artworks created by artificial intelligence. That means an algorithm programmed into a computer generated them. There are two main ways that looks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way AI learns how to do things such as generate art through a process called machine learning. This means that the system is given a set of data - in this case, artworks - and it learns to understand the similarities of these data before setting out to reproduce what it knows about artwork.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So, if the AI is fed a series of images from the renaissance period of art history, it'll eventually learn and recreate a piece of artwork that looks like a renaissance painting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people have taken issue with this - citing that it isn't really creating art, but simply regurgitating it.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>The other method is one which doesn't focus on guaranteeing cohesiveness with a genre, but one in which the artificial intelligence realizes what makes up the core components of the art it's processing, then uses what it knows to create a piece similar but with a distinct style.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latter is the technology used by the engineering team on super-computers at AI Art House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Are artificial intelligence paintings really art?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, that's for you to decide. Most people's opinion on this depends on the type of algorithm used to generate the art.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier we talked about machine learning, and how there are two main camps when it comes to this approach to creating AI artists. Well, each of these things has a name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When AI is given a set of images to process and recreate, this is known as a Generative Adversarial Network. It uses two neural network forms (processes of thinking similar to a human brain); one generates new things, the other checks the product against what it knows to guarantee similarity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The alternative process, where an AI develops its own technique, is known as a Creative Adversarial Network. Instead of checking for similarity, the neural network aims to create a piece that differs from the genres it knows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When 'Edmond de Belamy' sold, many people in both the art and artifical intelligence communities were upset. Many believed that simply learning to recreate images does not prove computer creativity in any way, it simply demonstrates an ability to understand the visual components of an image and methodically program them into a new picture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some think the CAN is more promising as signs of true creativity from AI, as it begins to build its own style. However, it's still dependent on an initial data set of pre-existing artwork, rather than creating its own from scratch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To some, the fact that AI generated art currently depends on machine learning and is not spontaneous/entirely autonomous means that it can't be deemed as art, as it's still relying on what its fed - which is subject to the biases of the human feeding it data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this sense, people think that AI needs to be truly autonomous, independent of a data set, in order to be considered truly creative and capable of making 'art'. AI currently can't do this, but perhaps in might in the future. </p>

<p>&nbsp;There are two types of AI painting. First, is the one above, you search what you want the painter to paint, choose your style, and it generate a painting. Second type, however, need you to make an outline, and it paint what you want for you. The outline is using a pen that represent things with different colours. Like the one below:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The one above is the original one, than, you can edit it in Adobe Photoshop to a painting that you want. Like the one below, it is the edited version oftehversion above.</p>
